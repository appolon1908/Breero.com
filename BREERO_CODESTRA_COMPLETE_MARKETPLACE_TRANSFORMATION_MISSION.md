# BREERO + CODESTRA COMPLETE MARKETPLACE TRANSFORMATION MISSION

## CODEX MASTER EXECUTION AUTHORITY

### Mission objective

Transform the existing `appolon1908/Breero.com` repository into a complete, enterprise-grade, two-sided home-services marketplace operating on the shared Codestra platform.

This is an **extension, hardening, integration, and completion mission**.

Do **not** rewrite working BREERO foundations.

Preserve the existing architecture where it is sound:

* FastAPI modular monolith
* PostgreSQL/PostGIS
* async SQLAlchemy
* Psycopg
* Alembic
* Redis
* Celery/background workers
* transactional outbox
* existing domain/service/repository layering
* existing frontend applications
* existing API contracts
* Keycloak integration
* provider/vendor/worker domains
* booking and job lifecycle foundations
* Stripe/payment foundations
* finance and payout foundations
* Odoo integration foundations
* current Docker/Caddy production work
* existing security hardening
* current capability/feature-flag safety model

The objective is to turn the current system into a complete marketplace rather than replace it.

   ↓
Project / Service Request
   ↓
Qualification
   ↓
Matching Engine
   ↓
Eligible Providers
   ↓
Opportunity / Lead
   ↓
Provider Acceptance

# 2. PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE

Treat Codestra as the platform.

Treat BREERO as one product running on that platform.

The major architecture is:

```text

| Business analytics               | Superset            |
| Infrastructure metrics           | Exporters           |

Do not duplicate platform responsibilities inside BREERO.

---

# 4. CRITICAL ODOO RULE

Monitoring systems must never directly mutate Odoo business data.

Forbidden:

```text
Prometheus → Odoo
Grafana → Odoo
Loki → Odoo
Tempo → Odoo
Alloy → Odoo
Exporter → Odoo
```

Correct:

```text
Operational Event
      ↓
Prometheus / Alertmanager
      ↓
Middleware
      ↓
Authorized workflow
      ↓
Odoo
```

Middleware must own:

* authentication
* authorization
* mapping
* schema translation
* deduplication
* idempotency
* retries
* audit
* dead-letter handling
* replay
* Odoo write policy

---

# 5. INITIAL CODEX PROCEDURE

Before changing code, Codex must inspect the current repository state.

Record:

```text
REPOSITORY
DEFAULT_BRANCH
CURRENT_MAIN_SHA
CURRENT_ALEMBIC_HEAD
CURRENT_OPENAPI_DIGEST
CURRENT_FRONTEND_CONTRACT_STATE
OPEN_PULL_REQUESTS
OPEN_P0_ISSUES
OPEN_P1_ISSUES
CURRENT_CAPABILITY_DEFAULTS
CURRENT_PRODUCTION_TOPOLOGY
CURRENT_STAGING_TOPOLOGY
CURRENT_KEYCLOAK_CONFIGURATION
CURRENT_KLYROW_INTEGRATION
CURRENT_TELNEXA_INTEGRATION
CURRENT_MIDDLEWARE_INTEGRATION
CURRENT_ODOO_INTEGRATION
CURRENT_OBSERVABILITY_STATE
```

Newer accepted repository state overrides older planning documents.

Do not work from stale branch assumptions.

---

# 6. DEVELOPMENT GOVERNANCE

Every substantial workstream gets its own branch and PR.

Do not create a permanent mega-branch.

Use dependency-safe sequencing.

Required rules:

```text
NO direct push to main
NO self-approval
NO ruleset bypass
NO stale-head merge
NO production deployment from feature branch
NO mutable latest image in production
NO migration first tested in production
NO capability activation hidden inside implementation PR
NO secret committed to Git
NO unreviewed Odoo write path
NO direct monitoring-to-Odoo writes
```

Each PR must have:

* focused ownership
* migrations when needed
* tests
* OpenAPI impact
* frontend contract impact
* security impact
* observability impact
* rollback/forward-fix boundary
* exact final SHA
* CI evidence
* independent review

---

# MILESTONE 0 — ARCHITECTURE INVENTORY AND BASELINE

## Exit criteria

Milestone closes only when architecture documentation matches executable code.

---

# MILESTONE 1 — PRODUCTION SAFETY FOUNDATION

## Priority

P0

## Objective

Create a release foundation safe enough to support later marketplace activation.

## Required work

### Infrastructure

* close critical host capacity issues
* no production filesystem near exhaustion
* establish isolated staging
* ensure PostgreSQL is private
* ensure Redis is private
* ensure application ports are only exposed through approved ingress
* reconcile competing Docker Compose definitions
* establish one canonical deployment authority
* health/readiness checks
* worker heartbeat
* scheduler heartbeat

### Release artifacts

Build once in trusted CI.

Produce:

```text
IMAGE_DIGESTS
SOURCE_SHA
SBOM
PROVENANCE
DEPENDENCY_SCAN
IMAGE_SCAN
OPENAPI_DIGEST

# MILESTONE 2 — IDENTITY, TENANCY, RBAC AND SECURITY

## Priority

P0

## Identity authority

Keycloak.

Canonical production issuer:

```text
https://auth.codestra.co/realms/codestra
```

## Browser authentication

Use:

```text
Authorization Code
+
PKCE S256
```

## Machine authentication

Use:

```text
OAuth2 Client Credentials
```

## Backend validation

Validate:

* issuer
* audience
* azp when required
* kid
* signature
* approved algorithm
* exp
* nbf
* iat
* subject
* tenant
* roles
* permissions

## Build

* external identity binding
* tenants/legal entities
* organizations
* memberships
* roles
* permissions
* server-created principal
* command context
* record policies
* provider boundaries
* worker boundaries
* customer resource ownership
* machine-account boundaries

## Negative tests

Required:

```text
wrong issuer
wrong audience
wrong algorithm
expired token
not-yet-valid token
unknown kid
malformed token
missing token
inactive user
removed membership
cross-tenant access
cross-provider access
cross-customer access
worker-to-unassigned-job access

Secret classes include:

* database credentials
* Redis credentials
* Keycloak clients
* Stripe
* Klyrow
* Telnexa
* SMTP
* SMPP
* signing keys
* webhook secrets
* Odoo credentials
* API provider credentials
* certificates

Prefer workload identities and short-lived credentials where supported.

## Exit criteria

Production authentication is Keycloak-authoritative and tenancy is fail-closed.

---

# MILESTONE 3 — API V1/V2 GOVERNANCE

## Priority

P0

## Objective

Create a predictable, versioned API platform.

Preserve compatible V1 behavior.

Introduce V2 additively.

Every endpoint must be registered.

Required registry fields:

```text
method
path
version
domain
owner
audience
authentication
permission
tenant_scope
record_policy
capability
rate_limit_class
idempotency_requirement
request_hash_policy
optimistic_version_policy
request_schema
response_schema
error_contract
PII_classification
event_effect
deprecation_state
replacement_endpoint
```

## State-changing commands

Every state-changing command must:

1. authenticate;
2. authorize;
3. validate tenant/record scope;
4. check capability;
5. validate command;
6. enforce idempotency;
7. enforce concurrency/version;
8. perform explicit state transition;
9. commit audit/history;
10. commit outbox event atomically;
11. return correlation identifier.

## Standard headers

Support where relevant:

```text
Authorization
Idempotency-Key
If-Match
ETag
X-Request-ID
X-Correlation-ID
Retry-After
WWW-Authenticate
```

## CI

CI fails if:

* OpenAPI is stale
* typed client is stale
* route missing from registry
* undocumented state-changing command exists
* frontend calls unknown route
* duplicate API ownership exists

## Exit criteria

OpenAPI and frontend typed contracts represent executable code exactly.

---

# MILESTONE 4 — CUSTOMER PROJECT AND SERVICE REQUEST SYSTEM

## Priority

```

Do not treat every service the same.

## Public submission hardening

Required:

* canonical request hash
* idempotency
* duplicate race protection
* timeout retry safety
* rate limiting
* Retry-After
* bot/honeypot controls
* consent version

---

# MILESTONE 5 — PROVIDER NETWORK AND ONBOARDING

## Priority

P1

## Objective

Build a marketplace-grade supply network.

## Provider organization

Fields should include:

* legal name
* DBA
* tax/business identifiers
* addresses
* contact data
* service categories
* territories
* approval state
* compliance state
* operational state
* payout configuration state

## Membership

Support:

```text
OWNER
ADMIN
DISPATCHER
TECHNICIAN
FINANCE
READ_ONLY
```

## Provider application lifecycle

```text
DRAFT
SUBMITTED
UNDER_REVIEW
APPROVED
REJECTED
SUSPENDED
EXPIRED
```

## Compliance

Track:

* business verification
* licenses
* insurance
* background checks
* service qualification

* audit history

Use the central document pipeline.

Do not implement a second independent upload/security system.

## Provider catalog

Support:

* services
* skills
* capabilities
* pricing mode
* service areas
* working hours
* capacity
* worker assignments

## Exit criteria

Only approved, qualified providers can become marketplace candidates.

---

# MILESTONE 6 — GEOGRAPHY, COVERAGE, SCHEDULING AND CAPACITY

## Priority

P1

## Geography

Use PostGIS.

Support:

* country
* state/province
* city
* ZIP/postal code
* county
* radius
* polygon
* service zone

## Address validation

Backend remains authoritative.

Frontend must not decide coverage.

Address failure policy:

```text
REQUEST_ACCEPTED_FOR_REVIEW=true
AUTOMATIC_SERVICEABILITY=false
AUTOMATIC_BOOKING=false
AUTOMATIC_ASSIGNMENT=false
```

## Timezone

Use authoritative IANA timezone derived from service address.

Test:

* DST forward
* DST backward
* ambiguous local time
* nonexistent local time
* Arizona
* Hawaii
* cross-timezone operations

## Capacity

Build:

* provider schedule
* worker schedule
* time off
* vacation
* sickness
* manual block
* holidays
* BREERO policy hours
* service duration
* travel buffer
* before/after buffer
* existing jobs
* active holds
* maximum jobs/day
* maximum minutes/day
* concurrent job limits
* emergency reserve

## Capacity hold lifecycle

```text
HELD
CONVERTED
EXPIRED
RELEASED
```

Default hold duration can be 30 minutes unless product configuration says otherwise.

## Mandatory race test

```text
Customer A requests last available slot.
Customer B requests same slot concurrently.

Expected:
Only authorized capacity survives.
```

## Performance objective

Availability search must avoid repeated N+1 database work.

Profile and optimize:

* provider candidate query
* service-zone checks
* worker availability
* active holds
* booking overlap queries
* schedule rules

## Exit criteria

Availability is authoritative, concurrent-safe and performant.

---

# MILESTONE 7 — MATCHING ENGINE

## Priority

P1

## Objective

Build explainable provider matching.

## Eligibility filters

Before scoring, provider must satisfy:

```text
active
approved
compliant
service qualified
skills qualified
coverage matched
schedule matched
capacity available
not suspended
no conflicting job/time off
emergency policy when applicable
```

## Matching inputs

Possible weighting inputs:

* distance
* estimated travel time
* exact skill
* service specialization
* available capacity
* response rate
* acceptance rate
* completion rate
* cancellation rate
* on-time rate
* verified rating
* complaint rate
* prior relationship
* emergency eligibility

## Explainability

Each candidate should include reason codes.

Example:

```json
{
  "eligible": true,
  "score": 0.83,
  "reasons": [
    "SERVICE_EXACT_MATCH",
    "INSIDE_PRIMARY_SERVICE_ZONE",
    "CAPACITY_AVAILABLE",
    "HIGH_COMPLETION_RATE"
  ]
}
```

Do not expose confidential internal risk scoring publicly.

## Initial operational mode

```text
PROVIDER_ASSIGNMENT_MODE=MANUAL
AUTO_ASSIGN_PROVIDER=false
AUTO_CONFIRM_BOOKING=false
```

Matching may recommend.

Human operations initially assigns.

## Exit criteria

Operators can understand why a provider was included, excluded and ranked.

---

# MILESTONE 8 — OPPORTUNITIES, LEADS AND CONNECTIONS

## Priority

P1

Create distinct domain concepts.

Do not collapse them.

```text
ProjectRequest
     ↓
MatchingRun
     ↓
Opportunity
     ↓
Provider Acceptance
     ↓
LeadConnection
```

An opportunity is not a customer connection.

Provider customer-PII access must remain restricted until authorized connection.

## Opportunity states

```text
OFFERED
VIEWED
ACCEPTED
DECLINED
EXPIRED
WITHDRAWN
```

## Lead connection states

```text
ACTIVE
CLOSED
CONVERTED
EXPIRED
```

## Commercial lead features

Infrastructure may support:

* lead pricing
* paid lead
* subscription
* featured placement

But default:

```text
PAID_LEADS_ENABLED=false
FEATURED_PROVIDERS_ENABLED=false
```

These require later commercial activation.

## Exit criteria

Customer information is disclosed only after authorized relationship establishment.

---

# MILESTONE 9 — CONVERSATIONS, QUOTES AND CHANGE ORDERS

## Priority

P1

## Messaging

Conversation exists only for authorized relationships.

Support:

* customer/provider messages
* support participants
* read/unread
* attachments
* timestamps
* moderation
* audit
* privacy filtering

## Quote lifecycle

```text
DRAFT
SUBMITTED
PENDING_CUSTOMER
ACCEPTED
DECLINED
EXPIRED
SUPERSEDED
```

Quotes are immutable by version.

Any revision creates a new version.

Store:

* labor
* materials
* fees
* tax
* discounts
* total
* assumptions
* terms
* expiration

## Customer acceptance

Acceptance does not automatically equal:

* payment
* booking confirmation
* job assignment

Each transition remains explicit.

## Change order lifecycle

```text
PROPOSED
UNDER_REVIEW
PENDING_CUSTOMER
ACCEPTED
REJECTED
PAYMENT_PENDING
APPROVED
```

Never silently mutate agreed scope.

## Exit criteria

Every scope/price change is versioned and auditable.

---

# MILESTONE 10 — BOOKING, DISPATCH AND JOB EXECUTION

## Priority

P1

## Booking lifecycle

Implement explicit state transitions.

Example:

```text
PENDING
AWAITING_PAYMENT
CONFIRMED
ASSIGNMENT_PENDING
ASSIGNED
IN_PROGRESS
COMPLETED
CANCELLED
FAILED
```

## Dispatch

Operations portal needs:

* unassigned jobs
* urgent jobs
* failed assignment
* candidates
* alternatives
* provider capacity
* technician capacity
* map context
* service zone
* travel estimate
* compliance
* timezone
* assign
* reassign
* unassign
* hold
* escalate

Every assignment change requires a reason and audit entry.

## Job state

Example:

```text
CREATED
ASSIGNED
EN_ROUTE
ARRIVED
STARTED
DIAGNOSTIC
PAUSED_FOR_CHANGE_ORDER
RESUMED
COMPLETED
CANCELLED
```

## Completion evidence

Support:

* photos
* notes
* timestamps
* signatures where appropriate
* technician identity
* scope confirmation
* customer acknowledgment

## Exit criteria

A booking can proceed to completed job with immutable history and recovery paths.

---

# MILESTONE 11 — KLYROW EMAIL INTEGRATION

## Repository

```text
appolon1908/klyrow.com
```

## Authority

Klyrow owns email transport.

BREERO does not become an SMTP platform.

## Integration path

```text
BREERO
↓
Transactional Outbox
↓
Middleware
↓
Klyrow
↓

```

## Callbacks

Process:

* submitted
* delivered
* deferred
* bounced
* complaint
* suppressed
* unsubscribed

Return relevant state through Middleware.

## Kill switch

```text
LIVE_EMAIL_DELIVERY=false
```

When false:

* zero real Klyrow deliveries
* events parked safely
* no false success
* retries cannot bypass switch

## Exit criteria

Transactional email delivery is traceable end-to-end.

---

# MILESTONE 12 — TELNEXA SMS INTEGRATION

---

# MILESTONE 13 — SHARED EVENT CONTRACT AND EVENT BUS

## Priority

P1

Define one Codestra event envelope.

Example:

```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "event_type": "booking.confirmed",
  "event_version": 1,
  "schema_version": 1,
  "source": "breero",
  "tenant_id": "uuid",
  "correlation_id": "uuid",
  "trace_id": "trace",
  "occurred_at": "timestamp",

```text
event_id
event_type
event_version
schema_version
source
tenant_id
correlation_id
trace_id
occurred_at
subject_type
subject_id
data
```

## Reliability

Implement:

* transactional outbox
* durable inbox
* event deduplication
* idempotent consumer
* leases
* stale lease recovery
* exponential retry
* dead-letter handling
* replay authorization
* reconciliation

## Event infrastructure

Use an approved broker.

Preferred options:

```text
Azure Service Bus
```

or platform-neutral:

```text
RabbitMQ
```

Do not add Kafka without a demonstrated requirement.

## Exit criteria

Business events are durable and recoverable across product boundaries.

# MILESTONE 14 — MIDDLEWARE CONTROL PLANE

## Objective

Middleware becomes the governed cross-system integration layer.

## Responsibilities

* event ingestion
* event validation
* normalization
* workflow routing
* Klyrow adapter
* Telnexa adapter
* VICIdial adapter
* Odoo adapter
* provider API adapters
* retry
* DLQ
* reconciliation
* idempotency
* schema mapping
* audit
* operational status

## Architecture rule

Applications publish business events.

Middleware determines how outside systems are updated.

Example:

```text
BREERO
└── JobCompleted.v1
        ↓
    Middleware
       ├── Odoo
       ├── Klyrow
       ├── analytics pipeline
       └── other approved integration
```

## Odoo

BREERO database remains marketplace truth.

Odoo remains CRM/operations projection.

Never make Odoo authoritative for core booking/job state unless explicitly redesigned.

## Exit criteria

All cross-system writes have one governed path.

---

# MILESTONE 15 — PAYMENTS AND FINANCIAL LEDGER

## Priority

P1/P2

Default:

```text
PAYMENTS_ENABLED=false
```

until certified.

## Stripe

Stripe is external settlement authority.

Backend remains authoritative for marketplace state.

## Required flows

* payment intent
* authorization
* capture
* webhook signature verification
* duplicate webhook handling
* timeout reconciliation
* refund
* partial refund
* dispute
* payment failure
* cancellation

Browser redirect is never proof of payment.

Only verified provider events settle payment.

## Ledger

Create immutable financial ledger entries for:

* customer charge
* tax
* platform fee
* provider gross earning
* provider adjustment
* refund
* dispute
* payout liability
* payout settlement
* reversal

Do not rely solely on mutable payment status fields.

## Exit criteria

Finance can reconstruct every balance from immutable financial history.

---

# MILESTONE 16 — PROVIDER EARNINGS AND PAYOUTS

## Default

```text
PAYOUTS_ENABLED=false
```

## Build

* provider earning
* pending earning
* available earning
* hold
* adjustment
* provider statement
* payout batch
* payout approval
* payout submission
* payout settlement
* payout failure
* reconciliation

## Separation of duties

Dispatch cannot approve payouts.

Support cannot approve payouts.

Provider cannot approve own payout.

Finance/admin approval must be server-enforced.

## Exit criteria

Every provider payout reconciles to jobs and ledger entries.

---

# MILESTONE 17 — REVIEWS, TRUST AND REPUTATION

## Priority

P2

Default:

```text
REVIEWS_ENABLED=false
```

until implemented.

## Eligibility

Only verified completed-job customers can review.

## Review data

* overall rating
* quality
* timeliness
* communication
* value
* written review
* photos where approved
* provider response
* moderation status
* abuse report status

## Performance model

Calculate approved provider metrics from real transactions:

* acceptance rate
* response rate
* completion rate
* cancellation rate
* reassignment rate
* on-time rate
* complaint rate
* verified rating
* repeat-customer rate

## Matching integration

Only approved reputation inputs feed matching.

No opaque public-risk score.

## Exit criteria

Completed work creates trustworthy marketplace reputation.

---

# MILESTONE 18 — SUPPORT, TRUST AND SAFETY

Build:

* support cases
* disputes
* customer complaints
* provider complaints
* trust review
* fraud review
* evidence
* internal notes
* customer-visible messages
* provider-visible messages
* escalation
* resolution

Internal notes must never leak externally.

All privileged actions require audit records.

---

# MILESTONE 19 — COMPLETE FRONTEND PRODUCT SURFACES

## Frontend quality

Every surface needs:

* loading
* empty
* disabled
* restricted
* error
* success
* retry
* offline/network failure
* responsive layout
* keyboard support
* accessible forms
* accessible dialogs
* real API data

# MILESTONE 21 — LOGGING AND TRACING

## Loki

All structured logs should carry safe context:

```text
timestamp
service.name
service.version
deployment.environment
severity
trace_id
span_id
request_id
correlation_id
tenant_id where safe
event_name
domain
```

Never log:

↓
PostgreSQL / Redis
↓
Outbox
↓
Middleware
↓
Klyrow / Telnexa / Odoo
```

Preserve:

```text

# MILESTONE 24 — API GATEWAY AND EDGE

## Caddy

Own:

* TLS
* certificate automation
* host routing
* reverse proxy
* approved service exposure

## Kong

Own:

* API policies
* authentication enforcement
* consumer policies
* rate limiting
* quota
* API keys
* OIDC/JWT
* API version routing
* transformations
* upstream policy

Avoid duplicated policy between Caddy and Kong.

Canonical direction:

# MILESTONE 25 — PRIVACY AND DATA GOVERNANCE

Classify data:

```text
PUBLIC
INTERNAL
CONFIDENTIAL
RESTRICTED
```

Define retention for:

* customer data
* provider data
* worker data
* communications
* job evidence
* financial records
* logs
* traces
* metrics
* support cases
* reviews

Implement:

* data export
* deletion requests
* retention jobs
* audit
* legal hold where needed
* consent history
* communication preferences

PII should not be copied to telemetry unnecessarily.

---

# MILESTONE 26 — AI AND 2026 INTELLIGENCE FEATURES

AI is advisory.

AI is not marketplace authority.

## Allowed AI use

* project-description clarification
* service classification
* missing-information detection
* scope summarization
* quote comparison
* support copilot
* operations summarization
* matching explanation
* fraud/anomaly triage
* review moderation assistance
* demand forecasting
* provider capacity forecasting
* natural-language analytics query

## AI may not independently

* approve provider
* verify license
* verify insurance
* create coverage
* create capacity
* promise a price
* accept quote
* assign provider
* confirm booking
* approve change order
* authorize refund
* authorize payout
* expose private data
* activate feature flags

AI results must pass deterministic business validation.

Store only approved metadata under retention/redaction policy.

---

# MILESTONE 27 — SECURITY HARDENING

Required:

DB query count
DB lock wait
Redis latency
worker queue delay
CPU
memory
connection pools
```

Optimize verified bottlenecks.

Do not prematurely split the modular monolith into microservices.

Extract services only when operational or scaling evidence justifies it.

---

# MILESTONE 30 — ISOLATED STAGING

Create staging completely separate from production.

Staging needs its own:

* PostgreSQL/PostGIS
* Redis
* API
* workers
* scheduler
* frontend
* Keycloak clients
* OpenBao paths
* DNS/TLS
* Klyrow safe account/recipients
* Telnexa sandbox routes

* synthetic users
* synthetic providers
* synthetic workers

## Personas

At minimum:

```text
customer
provider owner
provider admin
worker
dispatcher
support
trust
finance
platform admin
superadmin
```

## Staging proof

* clean database migration
* restored database migration
* backup/restore
* customer E2E
* provider E2E
* worker E2E
* ops E2E
* admin E2E
* role denial
* tenant denial
* integration failure recovery
* rollback
* load test
* observability

---

# MILESTONE 31 — PRODUCTION ACTIVATION

Production is the final milestone.

Not an implementation environment.

## Preflight

Require:

```text
FINAL_MAIN_SHA
REQUIRED_CHECKS=PASS

# 7. CAPABILITY ACTIVATION MATRIX

Implementation and activation are different changes.

Keep these dark by default until individually certified:

```text
PAYMENTS_ENABLED=false
PAYOUTS_ENABLED=false
PAID_LEADS_ENABLED=false
FEATURED_PROVIDERS_ENABLED=false
AUTO_ASSIGN_PROVIDER=false
AUTO_CONFIRM_BOOKING=false
MESSAGING_ENABLED=false
REVIEWS_ENABLED=false
LIVE_EMAIL_DELIVERY=false
LIVE_SMS_DELIVERY=false
MARKETING_ENABLED=false
AI_AUTOMATION_ENABLED=false
```

Each activation requires:

* code already merged
* staging evidence
* tests
* monitoring
* rollback
* independent approval
* production change record

---

# 8. SLO PROGRAM

Initial targets should be documented and tuned from real usage.

Recommended starting objectives:

### API

```text
Availability: ≥99.9%
p95 read latency: <500 ms for normal API calls
p95 mutation latency: <1 s excluding external provider delay
5xx rate: <1%
```

### Marketplace workflow

```text
request persistence success: >99.95%
outbox event creation: same transaction as domain mutation
matching processing success: >99.9%
```

### Communications

```text
accepted notification retained durably: 100%
provider outage must not lose event
delivery state eventually reconciled
```

### Workers

```text
heartbeat continuously monitored
stale worker alert
oldest outbox age alert
queue backlog alert
```

---

# 9. BRANCH PROGRAM

Use these branch families.

# 12. CODEX STOP CONDITIONS

Codex must stop rather than bypass controls when any required condition is unavailable.

Examples:

```text
independent reviewer unavailable
branch protection failure
unresolved security finding
staging unavailable
backup not verified
database migration uncertain
OpenBao authority unavailable
production credential unavailable
required external sandbox unavailable
release checks failing
production authorization missing
```

Never disable governance controls merely to finish the mission.

Never describe partial implementation as live.

Klyrow delivery
Telnexa delivery
Odoo projection
full observability
Superset analytics
backup/restore
rollback
