# CODEX MASTER MISSION — BREERO Premium Public Website Brand

Repository: `appolon1908/Breero.com`
Branch: `codex/premium-public-web-brand`

## Authority and scope

Implement the complete BREERO public website visual system and page family using the approved brand direction. Work autonomously through implementation, validation, screenshots, documentation, and a draft PR. Do not self-merge. Do not touch production/staging infrastructure, payments, finance, backend domain logic, jobs, migrations, DNS, or Caddy except for a tiny frontend-required contract correction that is clearly documented.

Only `apps/web` is a real runnable frontend. Do not turn placeholder customer, partner, operations, or admin directories into fake applications.

The visual source of truth is `docs/brand/BREERO_VISUAL_SYSTEM.md`. Read it before changing any public-facing UI. Every page and asset must follow its palette, image treatment, typography, radius, spacing, accessibility, and truth rules.

## Approved color tokens

Create centralized CSS/design tokens and use them everywhere:

```text
--breero-blue: #146EF5
--breero-blue-dark: #0E52C6
--breero-navy: #0B1F3A
--breero-ink: #10243E
--breero-teal: #18B7A0
--breero-teal-dark: #0F8C7A
--breero-coral: #FF6B6B
--breero-yellow: #FFC857
--breero-sky: #EAF4FF
--breero-mint: #EAFBF7
--breero-cream: #FFF8EC
--breero-gray-light: #F5F7FA
--breero-gray-mid: #66768A
--breero-border: #DCE4EC
--breero-white: #FFFFFF
--breero-success: #198754
--breero-warning: #B66A00
--breero-error: #C93838
```

Do not scatter raw color literals through page JSX unless required by an SVG asset. If a new color is unavoidable, add it centrally, document its purpose, and ensure WCAG AA contrast.

## Logo system

Use the approved logo direction: bold BREERO wordmark plus a rounded compact B/home/door/service mark. The primary mark may use blue with teal/coral/yellow accent; dark and white variants remain simplified for legibility.

Create or prepare centrally:

```text
apps/web/public/brand/
  breero-logo-primary.svg
  breero-logo-white.svg
  breero-logo-dark.svg
  breero-wordmark-primary.svg
  breero-wordmark-white.svg
  breero-wordmark-dark.svg
  breero-symbol-primary.svg
  breero-symbol-white.svg
  breero-symbol-dark.svg
  breero-favicon.svg
  favicon.ico
  apple-touch-icon.png
  icon-192.png
  icon-512.png
  og-default.png
```

Create:

```text
apps/web/components/brand/Logo.tsx
apps/web/components/brand/BrandMark.tsx
apps/web/components/brand/Wordmark.tsx
```

All pages must use these components rather than inline copies.

## Typography

Prefer Manrope throughout with Next.js font optimization. Use a second body family only if there is a measurable implementation benefit. Enforce the size system documented in `BREERO_VISUAL_SYSTEM.md`; marketing body copy must remain readable on mobile.

## Image architecture and permanent color rule

Create/maintain:

```text
apps/web/public/images/
  hero/
  services/
  lifestyle/
  trust/
  how-it-works/
  locations/
  partners/
  about/
  blog/
  campaigns/
  illustrations/
  placeholders/
```

Create `apps/web/content/images.ts` as the canonical runtime manifest. No marketing component may hardcode arbitrary image paths.

Every image must preserve the BREERO image treatment: bright natural daylight, clean white balance, warm realistic skin, attainable residential environments, competent approachable professionals, clean workwear, real tools/environment, and a subtle BREERO-blue visual cue where natural. Teal/coral/yellow are secondary accents only. Reject dark cinematic, neon, gray/desaturated stock, luxury mansion, heavy HDR, fake AI skin, and unrelated-color visual directions.

If an image cannot meet the brand treatment, do not use it merely to fill space.

Prepare exactly these 32 core slots:

```text
/images/hero/home-hero.webp
/images/hero/services-hero.webp
/images/hero/booking-hero.webp
/images/hero/trust-hero.webp
/images/hero/partner-hero.webp
/images/hero/about-hero.webp
/images/services/plumbing.webp
/images/services/electrical.webp
/images/services/handyman.webp
/images/services/heating.webp
/images/services/cooling.webp
/images/services/appliance-repair.webp
/images/services/cleaning.webp
/images/services/locksmith.webp
/images/services/painting.webp
/images/services/carpentry.webp
/images/services/moving-help.webp
/images/services/home-maintenance.webp
/images/lifestyle/happy-homeowner.webp
/images/lifestyle/technician-arrival.webp
/images/lifestyle/technician-working.webp
/images/lifestyle/family-home.webp
/images/lifestyle/clean-modern-home.webp
/images/lifestyle/booking-on-phone.webp
/images/trust/verified-professional.webp
/images/trust/quality-check.webp
/images/trust/support-team.webp
/images/trust/service-guarantee.webp
/images/about/breero-team.webp
/images/partners/partner-professional.webp
/images/partners/service-van.webp
/images/about/local-community.webp
```

Use WebP or AVIF runtime assets, Next/Image, correct dimensions, `sizes`, meaningful alt, lazy loading, and `priority` only for the above-fold hero.

## Page family

Prepare polished routes/templates for:

```text
/
/services
/how-it-works
/why-breero
/pricing
/trust
/service-guarantee
/about
/contact
/help
/partners
/locations
/services/plumbing
/services/electrical
/services/handyman
/services/heating
/services/cooling
/services/appliance-repair
/services/cleaning
/services/locksmith
/services/painting
/services/carpentry
/services/moving-help
/services/home-maintenance
/book
/availability
/faq
/reviews
/emergency
/home-care
/careers
/press
/blog
/privacy
/terms
/cookies
/locations/[slug]
```

Do not create pointless routes merely to meet a count. Only expose functionality that actually works. Partner is informational only until onboarding exists.

## Homepage

Implement in this order:

1. navigation
2. premium asymmetric hero
3. service search/category area
4. trust strip
5. popular services
6. how it works
7. lifestyle image feature
8. why BREERO
9. verified testimonials only when real/configured
10. guarantee/trust section
11. supported locations
12. homeowner CTA
13. partner informational CTA
14. FAQ
15. final booking CTA
16. premium footer

Headline: `Home services, without the hassle.`
Subheadline: `Book trusted professionals for repairs, maintenance and everyday home services.`
Primary CTA: `Book a service`
Secondary CTA: `Explore services`

Hero must not become a generic empty text-left/photo-right template. Use depth, one meaningful large image, useful service discovery, and at most 2–3 small trust/status accents.

## Service pages

Every service page must use a consistent template while retaining meaningful content:

- breadcrumb
- hero
- service name and short promise
- primary and secondary CTA
- hero/service image
- trust bar
- common problems
- what is included
- how booking works
- pricing explanation without invented pricing
- service options only when supported
- why BREERO
- professional standards
- verified reviews only when available
- service-area CTA
- FAQ
- final CTA

Use 2–3 meaningful images per service page, generally reusing the central service/lifestyle inventory rather than generating duplicates.

## Content architecture

Separate content from layout.

Create/maintain:

```text
apps/web/content/
  brand.ts
  cta.ts
  navigation.ts
  footer.ts
  images.ts
  services.ts or services/*.ts
  locations.ts
  testimonials.ts
  faqs.ts
  pages/
  campaigns/
```

A content editor should be able to change copy, CTA labels, images, service descriptions, or location content without JSX surgery.

## Shared components

Create/standardize reusable marketing sections, including where useful:

```text
Hero
TrustBar
ServiceGrid
ServiceCard
HowItWorks
WhyBreero
TestimonialGrid
Stats
FAQ
CTASection
FeatureSplit
ImageFeature
LocationGrid
PartnerCTA
Guarantee
ProcessTimeline
ReviewSummary
BookingCTA
NewsletterCTA
```

Use one icon family, preferably Lucide or the existing project standard. Do not mix arbitrary SVG packs or emoji icons.

## Mobile and responsive requirements

Prove at: 375, 430, 768, 1024, 1280, 1440, 1920.

Mobile is not a compressed desktop. Prioritize service discovery, booking, readable cards, accessible navigation, and 44×44px practical tap targets. No horizontal overflow and no broken floating hero elements at 375px.

## Accessibility

Require semantic landmarks, skip navigation, keyboard menus, visible focus, labels, accessible drawers/accordions/dialogs, contrast, meaningful alt, and `prefers-reduced-motion`. Run axe against homepage, services, a service detail, how-it-works, booking entry, about, and contact.

## Truth and safety rules

Never fabricate:
- customer counts
- ratings
- reviews/testimonials
- certifications
- insurance promises
- pricing
- service availability
- serviceability areas
- partner earnings
- guarantees not backed by the business

Render stats/testimonials only when source/config marks them verified. No fake customer/partner/ops/admin portal links.

## SEO and public hygiene

Every public page gets a unique title, description, canonical, OpenGraph metadata, and structured headings. Use structured data only when accurate: Organization, WebSite, Service, FAQPage, BreadcrumbList. Never create fake review/rating schema.

Generate sitemap only from actual published routes. Production public pages may be indexed; staging must remain NOINDEX/NOFOLLOW.

## Git-friendly editing

Preserve these replacement boundaries:

```text
Logo      -> apps/web/public/brand/
Images    -> apps/web/public/images/
Colors    -> centralized tokens/CSS variables
Text      -> apps/web/content/
Layout    -> apps/web/app/[route]/page.tsx
Reusable  -> apps/web/components/marketing/
```

A designer replacing a file such as `apps/web/public/images/services/plumbing.webp` with another image of the same name must update every use automatically.

## Documentation to finish

Create or update:

```text
docs/brand/README.md
docs/brand/colors.md
docs/brand/typography.md
docs/brand/logo-guidelines.md
docs/brand/images.md
docs/brand/voice.md
docs/brand/cta-system.md
docs/brand/editing-the-website.md
docs/brand/page-inventory.md
docs/brand/asset-inventory.md
```

Document every image filename, route, section, aspect ratio, recommended dimensions, alt intent, and status.

## Validation

Run all available project checks:

```text
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm contract:check
```

Run Playwright in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit where supported. Validate relevant widths. Add automated validation that every image referenced by the image manifest exists and every internal CTA points to a real route. Broken marketing images or internal links must fail CI.

Run representative Lighthouse checks and report Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO without gaming the result.

## Screenshot acceptance

Produce visual review screenshots for:

```text
/
/services
one service detail
/how-it-works
/why-breero
/trust
/partners
/about
/contact
/book
```

At 375, 768, and 1440 widths.

Review spacing, crop, logo, headings, button hierarchy, contrast, card alignment, image quality, mobile navigation, footer, and CTA consistency.

## Git delivery

Stay on `codex/premium-public-web-brand`. Keep infrastructure changes out of this branch. Commit intentionally. Open or update a draft PR targeting the current accepted frontend/application base. Do not self-merge.

## Final report

Return exact:

1. starting SHA
2. final SHA
3. routes implemented
4. public page count
5. service page count
6. image slot count and filenames
7. logo outputs
