# OpenBao API secret integration

Source authority: [Codestra-OpenBao](https://github.com/appolon1908/Codestra-OpenBao).
The machine-readable contract is `openbao-secret-consumer.v1.json`.
This change prepares file-based credential consumption; runtime binding is unverified.

For each admitted process, render its bundle in Codestra-OpenBao using
`scripts/render_application_secrets.py`. The default selection contains required
startup bindings; add `--include SETTING_NAME` only for an enabled integration.
Run the agent as the same non-root UID/GID as its consumer. Use private directories
on a memory-backed volume and read-only mounts in the application container.
The agent writes mode 0400, with no backup copy or token sink. Consumers accept
0400 or 0600 private regular files owned by the runtime user. Docker Compose secrets
may also be root-owned 0444 regular files directly under `/run/secrets`, but only
when the opened file is on a read-only mount. Links, directories,
pipes, empty/oversized/invalid files and conflicting inline credentials are rejected.
Remove the matching inline environment setting when supplying its `_FILE` setting.
A configured file failing to load stops configuration; it never falls back to an
inline value. Local development without a file retains existing configuration behavior.

The agent reads KV-v2 records with a string `payload` field. The logical namespace
below maps to `/v1/codestra/data/<environment>/...` in the private native API.
No provider credentials belong in browser variables, images, Git or logs.
OpenBao bootstrap/unseal keys and user/customer records are outside this contract.

Settings are loaded at process startup. After Agent renders a rotated value,
restart the affected consumer under the rollout supervisor, verify provider access,
and revoke the old credential only after successful cutover. Static KV refresh is
not provider-key rotation. A reader observing a new file does not prove that an
already-running SDK client has reloaded it. Never dump settings or error `.errors()`
payloads; Pydantic error formatting and secret-field repr are redacted here, but
application-specific diagnostic serialization still requires care.

Logical prefix: `codestra/<environment>/breero/api/runtime/`.

| Setting | File reference | Startup required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `DATABASE_URL_FILE` | Yes |
| `REDIS_URL` | `REDIS_URL_FILE` | Yes |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `JWT_SECRET_FILE` | Yes |
| `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` | `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET_FILE` | Yes |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_FILE` | When integration requires it |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_FILE` | When integration requires it |
| `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_FILE` | When integration requires it |
| `GEOCODING_API_KEY` | `GEOCODING_API_KEY_FILE` | When integration requires it |
| `PAYOUT_API_KEY` | `PAYOUT_API_KEY_FILE` | When integration requires it |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | `SMTP_PASSWORD_FILE` | When integration requires it |
| `SMS_API_KEY` | `SMS_API_KEY_FILE` | When integration requires it |
| `MIDDLEWARE_HMAC_SECRET` | `MIDDLEWARE_HMAC_SECRET_FILE` | When integration requires it |
| `MIDDLEWARE_CLIENT_KEY` | `MIDDLEWARE_CLIENT_KEY_FILE` | When integration requires it |

Breero must never receive an Odoo API key. `ODOO_ENABLED`, inline `ODOO_API_KEY`,
and `ODOO_API_KEY_FILE` are rejected before secret files are read. Only Middleware
may consume the Odoo integration credential; Breero receives its scoped Middleware identity.

For file-backed Compose secrets, do not rely on Compose `uid`/`mode` remapping.
Provision host files as UID 10001, mode 0400 (preferred), or root-owned mode 0444
inside a root-only host directory and mount each file read-only at `/run/secrets`.
Root-owned 0600 files cannot be read by UID 10001 and must be reprovisioned before
rollout. Do not change permissions on live credential files as part of validation.
