# BREERO Marketplace V2 — Final Backend Production Implementation

**Repository:** existing `appolon1908/Breero.com` monorepo
**Backend application:** `apps/api`
**Implementation principle:** domain-first modular monolith
**Database:** existing PostgreSQL/PostGIS database and naming conventions
**Current safety foundation:** PR #35
**First implementation branch:** `be/marketplace-v2-p0-api-foundation`

---

## 1. Architectural rule

BREERO is a domain application exposed through HTTP.

The dependency direction is:

```text
FastAPI Router
      ↓
Application Command
      ↓
Domain Service
      ↓
Policies + State Machine
      ↓
Repository / Query
      ↓
SQLAlchemy
      ↓
PostgreSQL/PostGIS

```

A router may:

- parse HTTP input;
- resolve Principal;
- resolve command context;
- call a domain service;
- map domain result to response DTO.

A router must not contain:

- marketplace state transitions;
- matching logic;
- provider eligibility;
- credential rules;
- financial rules;
- direct third-party calls;
- tenant ownership logic;
- outbox delivery;
- database transaction orchestration beyond dependency injection.

---

## 2. Canonical marketplace lifecycle

```text
Customer Intent
      ↓
ProjectRequest
      ↓
Qualification
      ↓
Fulfillment Decision
      ↓
Matching
      ↓
Opportunity
      ↓
LeadConnection
      ↓
Conversation + Quote
      ↓
Scheduling
      ↓
Booking
      ↓
Job
      ↓
Completion
      ↓
Verified Review

```

Definitions:

```text
ProjectRequest = customer demand
Matching       = provider eligibility + ranking
Opportunity    = controlled provider invitation
LeadConnection = authorized customer/provider relationship
Quote          = commercial proposal
Booking        = scheduling outcome
Job            = field execution
Review         = completed-job trust signal

```

## 3. Backend branch sequence

P0 shared foundation:

```text
be/marketplace-v2-p0-api-foundation

Marketplace domains:

```text
be/marketplace-v2-catalog

be/marketplace-v2-provider-core
be/marketplace-v2-provider-onboarding
be/marketplace-v2-provider-trust
be/marketplace-v2-provider-availability

```

Later gated domains:

```text
be/marketplace-v2-payments
be/marketplace-v2-payouts
be/marketplace-v2-subscriptions

```

One PR per workstream.

Never recreate a 100+ commit integration PR.

---

# 4. Shared domain infrastructure

Add/normalize under the existing domain/common architecture:

```text
apps/api/app/domains/common/

commands.py
command_context.py

domain_event.py
state_machine.py

idempotency_service.py
audit_service.py

outbox_service.py
inbox_service.py

exception_service.py

pagination.py
money.py
clock.py

```

Authorization:

```text
apps/api/app/domains/authorization/

principal.py
permissions.py
policies.py
dependencies.py

```

Capabilities:

```text
apps/api/app/domains/capabilities/

service.py
registry.py
dependencies.py
schemas.py

```

Do not duplicate the capability implementation already created by PR #35.

---

# 5. Command context

Every important mutation receives:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class CommandContext:
    actor_id: UUID | None
    principal_type: str

    tenant_id: UUID | None
    legal_entity_id: UUID | None

    idempotency_key: str | None

    request_id: str
    correlation_id: str

    ip_address: str | None
    user_agent: str | None

```

All domain audit/outbox records inherit the correlation ID.

---

# 6. Production authentication

Production authentication authority:

```text
Keycloak / OIDC

```

Human users:

```text
Authorization Code + PKCE

```

Machine identities:

```text
Client Credentials

```

Validate:

```text
signature
issuer
audience
authorized party where applicable
subject
expiration
not-before
issued-at
token algorithm
key id

```

JWKS:

```text
cache keys
support rotation
refresh once on unknown kid
reject after failed refresh

```

---

# 7. External identity binding

Identity is:

```text
OIDC issuer + subject

```

Never email.

Add an additive migration for:

```text
external_identities

```

Fields:

```text
id UUID PK
user_id UUID FK

issuer VARCHAR NOT NULL
subject VARCHAR NOT NULL

email_at_link_time VARCHAR NULL

created_at TIMESTAMPTZ
last_seen_at TIMESTAMPTZ

UNIQUE(issuer, subject)

```

Email may change without creating a second user.

---

# 8. Principal

Resolve authentication into:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Principal:
    user_id: UUID

    issuer: str
    subject: str

    roles: frozenset[str]
    permissions: frozenset[str]

    provider_ids: frozenset[UUID]

    worker_id: UUID | None

    tenant_id: UUID | None
    legal_entity_ids: frozenset[UUID]

```

Domain services consume Principal rather than JWT dictionaries.

---

# 9. Roles

```text
CUSTOMER

PROVIDER_OWNER
PROVIDER_MANAGER
WORKER

DISPATCHER
CUSTOMER_SUPPORT
TRUST_SAFETY
FINANCE

ADMIN
SUPER_ADMIN

```

---

# 10. Permissions

At minimum:

```text
project_request.read
project_request.manage

matching.run
matching.inspect

opportunity.read
opportunity.respond
opportunity.manage

quote.read
quote.create
quote.send
quote.accept

conversation.read
conversation.send

booking.read
booking.manage

job.read
job.assign
job.execute
job.complete

provider.read
provider.manage

provider.credentials.manage
provider.credentials.verify

provider.suspend

review.create
review.respond
review.moderate

dispute.create
dispute.manage

integration.read
integration.retry

finance.refund
finance.payout.approve

admin.users.manage
admin.features.manage
admin.audit.read

```

Role is not authorization by itself.

---

# 11. Record-level authorization

Authorization requires:

```text
authentication
+
permission
+
record ownership
+
provider membership
+
tenant/legal entity
+
resource state

```

Customer example:

```text
request.customer_id == principal.customer_id

```

Provider example:

```text
active provider membership
AND
resource.provider_id is in principal.provider_ids

```

Worker example:

```text
job.worker_id == principal.worker_id

```

Whenever practical, ownership filtering belongs in SQL.

Prefer:

```python
repository.quote_for_provider(
    quote_id,
    provider_id,
)

```

instead of:

```python
quote = repository.by_id(quote_id)

if quote.provider_id != provider_id:
    ...

```

---

# 12. Capabilities

Keep the existing canonical capability authority introduced by PR #35.

Do not create a second configuration system.

The domain registry eventually represents:

```text
request_intake

marketplace_matching
provider_opportunities
provider_self_service

quotes
messaging
reviews

instant_booking
automatic_assignment

payments
payouts
paid_leads

marketing

```

A capability becomes effective only when:

```text
code available
AND
release flag enabled
AND
dependencies enabled
AND
runtime provider ready
AND
environment permits it

```

Every sensitive backend command checks the capability.

Frontend visibility is not enforcement.

---

# 13. Capability guard

Concept:

```python
def require_capability(name: str):
    async def dependency(
        registry: CapabilityRegistry = Depends(get_capabilities),
    ):
        if not registry.enabled(name):
            raise CapabilityDisabled(name)

    return dependency

```

Domain service still validates capability for important commands so internal callers cannot bypass it.

---

# 14. Idempotency

Add:

```text
idempotency_records

```

Using current table naming conventions.

Fields:

```text
id UUID PK

actor_key VARCHAR
operation VARCHAR
idempotency_key VARCHAR

request_hash VARCHAR

status VARCHAR

resource_type VARCHAR NULL
resource_id UUID NULL

response_code INTEGER NULL
response_json JSONB NULL

created_at
updated_at
expires_at

UNIQUE(actor_key, operation, idempotency_key)

```

States:

```text
IN_PROGRESS
COMPLETED
FAILED

```

---

# 15. Commands requiring idempotency

At minimum:

```text
ProjectRequest submit

Provider application submit

Opportunity accept
Opportunity decline

Quote send
Quote revise
Quote accept
Quote decline

Booking confirm
Booking cancel

Job assignment
Job transition
Job completion

Review submit

Dispute create

Integration manual retry

Payment intent
Refund
Payout

```

Rules:

```text
same key + same request
→ same business result

same key + different request
→ 409

same key + processing
→ conflict/retry response

```

---

# 16. Optimistic concurrency

Important aggregates carry:

```text
version INTEGER NOT NULL

```

At minimum:

```text
ProjectRequest
Opportunity
Quote
Booking
Job
Provider

```

Update pattern:

```sql
UPDATE ...
SET ...,
    version = version + 1
WHERE id = :id
  AND version = :expected_version

```

Zero updated rows:

```text
409 CONCURRENT_MODIFICATION

```

Use row locks for commands where serialization is required.

---

# 17. Atomic business command

Important mutation transaction:

```text
business mutation
+
status history
+
audit event
+
idempotency completion
+
outbox event
=
ONE POSTGRESQL COMMIT

```

Never emit domain events after committing business state.

---

# 18. API V2 foundation

Create under:

```text
apps/api/app/api/v2/

```

Routers:

```text
router.py

catalog.py
project_requests.py
providers.py

customer.py
partner.py
worker.py

matching.py
opportunities.py

quotes.py
conversations.py

bookings.py
jobs.py
reviews.py

notifications.py
disputes.py

operations.py
admin.py

analytics.py
integrations.py
uploads.py

```

Keep V1 routes during migration.

No placeholder production endpoints returning fake success.

---

# 19. Capability endpoint compatibility

The existing canonical capability contract introduced by PR #35 remains authoritative.

If API V2 later exposes a compatibility projection, it must call the same `CapabilityService`.

Do not maintain:

```text
V1 capabilities
and
different V2 capabilities

```

---

# 20. API error contract

Standardize errors:

```json
{
  "code": "QUOTE_EXPIRED",
  "message": "The quote has expired.",
  "correlation_id": "...",
  "fields": null
}

```

Common status behavior:

```text
400 malformed command
401 authentication
403 authorization
404 unavailable/not found
409 state/concurrency/idempotency conflict
422 field/domain validation
429 rate limit
5xx platform/dependency failure

```

Do not expose internal stack traces.

# 47. Audit

Append-only:

```text
audit_events

```

Fields:

```text
id
actor_id
actor_type

tenant_id
legal_entity_id

action

resource_type
resource_id

correlation_id

ip_address
user_agent

metadata_json

created_at

```

Never store secrets in audit metadata.

---

# 48. Analytics

Track:

```text
request_started
request_submitted
request_qualified
request_matched

opportunity_sent
opportunity_viewed
opportunity_accepted

quote_created
quote_sent
quote_accepted

booking_created

job_started
job_completed

review_submitted

repeat_request

```

Metrics:

```text
request conversion
serviceability
match rate
time to first match

provider response time
opportunity acceptance

quote rate
quote-to-book

completion
cancellation

repeat customers
provider retention

AOV when enabled
GMV when enabled
take rate when enabled

```

Analytics must not block operational commands.

Use domain event projection.

---

# 49. Database migration rules

Use the existing Alembic head.

Do not assume revision numbers before implementation.

Conceptual order:

```text
identity binding
shared command/audit/idempotency

ProjectRequest/catalog

provider marketplace
trust/availability

matching/opportunities

quotes/messages

booking/job/reviews

storage/uploads
notifications

exceptions/disputes

integration inbox/outbox

analytics

payments later

```

Use:

```text
expand
→ compatible code
→ backfill
→ validate
→ contract

```

Never big-bang destructive migrations.

---

# 50. Database indexes

Required high-value indexes include:

```text
project_requests(customer_id, created_at)
project_requests(status, created_at)
project_requests(service_id, status)

provider status/service indexes

PostGIS GiST service-area indexes

provider_credentials(provider_id, status, expires_at)

availability(provider_id, weekday)

matching_runs(project_request_id, created_at)
match_candidates(matching_run_id, eligible, rank)

opportunities(provider_id, status, expires_at)
opportunities(project_request_id, status)

quotes(project_request_id, status)
quotes(provider_id, status)

messages(conversation_id, created_at)

bookings(provider_id, window_start)

jobs(provider_id, status)
jobs(worker_id, status)

reviews(provider_id, created_at)

outbox(status, available_at)

exceptions(status, type, created_at)

audit(resource_type, resource_id, created_at)

```

Use EXPLAIN/ANALYZE for production-heavy queries.

---

# 51. Backend testing

Every domain needs:

```text
policy tests
state-machine tests
service tests

repository tests
real PostgreSQL tests

authorization tests
negative authorization tests

idempotency tests
concurrency tests

migration tests

event/outbox tests

```

PostGIS tests must use actual PostGIS.

SQLite is not a substitute.

---

# 52. Mandatory concurrency tests

At least:

```text
ProjectRequest submit

Opportunity accept

Quote accept

Booking creation

Job assignment

Review creation

Integration inbox deduplication

Payments later

```

Example:

```text
20 simultaneous quote acceptance commands
→ exactly one accepted state
→ exactly one booking
→ remaining requests replay/conflict safely

```

---

# 53. Backend Definition of Done

Marketplace backend is not complete until:

```text
OIDC works

issuer+subject identity linking works

record authorization works

capability enforcement works

idempotency works

optimistic concurrency works

audit works

ProjectRequest works

matching works

opportunities work

quotes work

messaging works

booking/job bridge works

reviews work

storage/scanning works

notifications work

Ops exceptions work

integration outbox/inbox work

all migrations pass

PostgreSQL/PostGIS tests pass

OpenAPI is generated

payments remain disabled until separately approved

```
